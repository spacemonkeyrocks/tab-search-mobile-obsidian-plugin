## 3. Unresolved Issues & Next Steps
### Bugs
- [x] **Initial State UI:** Search interface shows "No matching tabs found" on initial open instead of the placeholder text.
- [x] **Extraneous Subtitle:** Debug text ("Mobile tab element") is visible under tab titles in search results.
- [-] **Settings Wording:** The "Show only titles" setting needs to be rephrased to "Include file path" and its logic inverted.
    - Dropped this feature as the  current Obsidian Mobile API does not support this

### Enhancements
- [x] **Highlight Matches:** Implement highlighting of matching text within the search results.
- [x] **Case-Sensitivity Toggle:** Add a button to the search bar to toggle case-sensitive searching.
