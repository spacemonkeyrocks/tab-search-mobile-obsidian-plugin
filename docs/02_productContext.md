# Product Context: Why This Plugin Exists

## 1. The Problem
The Obsidian mobile app is a powerful tool for knowledge management, allowing users to keep multiple notes open as tabs. However, as the number of open tabs grows, the user experience for navigating between them degrades. The default tab switcher requires users to manually scroll through a grid of small "cards," one for each tab. For a user with 15, 30, or 50+ tabs open, finding a specific one becomes a frustrating and time-consuming task of "scroll and hunt." This friction discourages users from leveraging the app's multi-tab capabilities to their full potential.

## 2. The Solution & User
**Target User:** The plugin is designed for any Obsidian mobile user who feels overwhelmed by tab managementâ€”from power users and researchers managing complex projects to casual users who simply don't close their tabs often.

**User Story:**
> "As an active Obsidian mobile user, when I'm in the tab switcher view with many tabs open, **I want to** be able to search for a specific tab by its title, **so that I can** instantly jump to it without endless scrolling."

**Core Value Proposition:**
The plugin's value is centered on **speed and reduced cognitive load**. It transforms a tedious, multi-step process (open switcher, scroll, visually scan, tap) into a simple, direct action (tap search, type, tap result). This makes the mobile app significantly more efficient for users who treat Obsidian as a true "second brain" and need to move between ideas fluidly.
