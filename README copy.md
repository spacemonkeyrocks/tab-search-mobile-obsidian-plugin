## Installation
- Search for "Floating Back to Top Button" in Obsidian's Community Plugins browser.
- Click `Install`, then `Enable`.

## Manual Installation
- Go to the latest GitHub release page.
- You have two options:
    - **Easy (Recommended):** Download the `back-to-top-action-btn-[version].zip` file and unzip it into your Obsidian vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory.
    - **Advanced:** Download the individual `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files. Create a new folder named `back-to-top-action-btn` inside `.obsidian/plugins/` and place the three files inside.
