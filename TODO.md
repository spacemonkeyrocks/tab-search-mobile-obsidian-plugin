# TO DO

- [x] File logging isn't working
- [x] Test search functionality
- [x] Search box should be at the top of the screen
- [x] Use same auto theme and position detection for button as back-to-top-plugin
- [x] Add a magnifying glass icon at the beginning of the search bar
- [x] Add version to Settings page like back-to-top-plugin
- [x] Why is the button not being positioned at exactly the same place as the default Obsidian action button that the theme and position was detected from?
- [x] Add a circle with x in it icon at the end of the search bar, see image I shared as an example
- [x] Make the circle with x a bit bigger
- [x] When the user tries to activate the plugin on the Desktop is should throw an error and not start, I do get a message, but the plugin is not throwing an exception so it loads
- [x] Opening text is still not "Type to search" instead of "No matching tabs found", that should appear when something has been entered and there is no match
- [x] "Mobile tab element" still visible underneath the title, see screenshot
- [ ] Please highlight the matching text in titles
- [ ] Is the dom-observer.js documented? And the logging.js? Both are reusable libraries that can be useful for and used in other plugin projects.
